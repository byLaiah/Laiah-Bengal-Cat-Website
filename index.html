  <h2>So what are Bengal cats?</h2>
  <p>
    Bengal cats are hybrids between domestic cats and the wild Asian leopard cat,
    which gives them their iconic mini‑leopard look.
    In the 1960s and 70s, a researcher called Dr Willard Centerwall bred Asian leopard
    cats with domestic cats while studying genetics and disease resistance.
    Later, breeder Jean Mill took some of these hybrids, continued the breeding
    programme, and helped turn them into the Bengal breed we know today.
    She first called them “Leopardettes”, but the name was changed to Bengal after
    the Asian leopard cat’s scientific name, <em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em>.

    Bengal cats come in lots of different colours and patterns. The main recognised
    colours are brown, silver and snow, but you can also see other colours like
    charcoal, blue or melanistic (black). Their coats can be spotted or marbled,
    and some cats have a mix sometimes called “sparbled”, all with very high
    contrast that makes them look wild.Understanding the genetics behind Bengal cat coat colors and patterns adds another layer of fascination to the breed. The interaction of various genes, including agouti, inhibitor, and spotted/rosetted genes, determines the final appearance of a Bengal cat's coat. Responsible breeders carefully select and pair cats through DNA test and Punnett Square to achieve specific colorations and patterns, ensuring the preservation of the breed's unique aesthetics.

  <h2>Soo do you want a Bengal? 😏</h2>
  <p>
    It’s no surprise if you’ve fallen in love with one of the most beautiful cats
    on earth and now want one of your own. You can find many Bengals by going to
    a responsible breeder or by looking for Bengals that need new homes through
    rescue and rehoming groups.

    If someone wanted a Bengal cat in the UK, they would need to do careful
    research and choose an ethical source. People usually either go to
    responsible breeders or look for Bengals that need new homes through rescue
    and rehoming groups.When you’re looking to get a Bengal kitten, it’s important to decide which filial generation is the right fit for you. There are two main groups of generations- foundation Bengals (also called early generation) and SBT Bengals (Stud Book Tradition).

    All Bengal cats share similar traits: beautiful spotted coat, lean and strong figure and lovable personalities.

    However, as the earlier generations of Bengals are closer to their wildcat ancestors, their appearance and character are much similar to the Asian Leopard cat than it is the case with SBT Bengal’s. The foundation Bengals are not even recognized as domestic pets and they are usually reserved for breeding purposes or experienced owners.

    Most Bengal cat breeders in the USA and the UK offer only Stud Book Tradition Bengal kittens for sale, since they are more suitable to be raised as pets. The SBT kittens display all the characteristics of fully domestic purebred Bengals: they are intelligent and playful, socialize quickly and have the recognizable leopard-like fur.
